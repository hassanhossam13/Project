Call Center Performance Analysis
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes Call Center operational performance using Python.
The goal is to evaluate agent performance, call handling efficiency, abandonment rates, and monthly trends to generate actionable business insights.

The analysis includes:

KPI evaluation

Monthly performance tracking

Agent performance comparison

Correlation analysis

Efficiency measurement

Visual data exploration

📂 Dataset Description

The dataset contains daily call center operational data with the following columns:

Column	Description
Project	Project name
Date	Call date
Forecasted Calls	Expected number of calls
Calls Offered	Total incoming calls
Calls Handled	Successfully handled calls
Calls Handled Within Threshold	Calls answered within SLA
Calls Abandon	Dropped calls
ASA	Average Speed of Answer
Answer Time	Total answering time
Agent Name	Agent responsible
🎯 Business Questions

This analysis answers the following questions:

What is the total call volume per month?

How accurate is call forecasting?

What is the abandonment rate per month?

Which agents have the highest answer time?

Which agents handle the most calls within SLA?

What is the overall handling efficiency?

Is there a relationship between:

Forecasted Calls & Calls Offered?

ASA & Calls Abandon?

📌 Key Insights

Handling efficiency reached approximately 98%.

March showed the highest call volume.

Higher ASA is positively correlated with higher abandoned calls.

Some agents consistently outperform others in handling calls within SLA.
